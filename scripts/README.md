This directory contains convenience scripts for monitoring, testing, and maintaining an IMAGE server.
Even though some of them may assume McGill-specific paths and tools, we include them in the repository since we expect they will serve as useful examples even though they may require modification for your specific environment.

Documentation can be found as comments within each script.
