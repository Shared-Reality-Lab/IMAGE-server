IMAGE Preprocessors
What preprocessors are and how they work
Preprocessors are docker services that take the initial request and extract meaningful information, placing it into a JSON block that then gets passed to the handlers so they can create renderings. For example, an object detection preprocessor examines a photograph and outputs a JSON block that contains the coordinates of bounding boxes for various objects like people, umbrellas, and neckties.

Each preprocessor advertises itself to the orchestrator component by adding the label `ca.mcgill.a11y.image.preprocessor: [priority]`. The priority is a number that determines the order in which the preprocessors will be run, starting with lower values. For example, a preprocessor that groups detected objects together would need to run after the object detector had already run (and found the individual objects!), so it would have a higher priority number than the object detector itself. Multiple preprocessors can have the same priority if they do not have any dependency on each-other, which lets them run in parallel, speeding up the overall response time. Once labeled in this way, the preprocessor will receive HTTP requests at `/preprocess` containing the request, plus all of the JSON generated by previously run preprocessors.

More information on preprocessors and how they fit into the overall system is available on the wiki.

What is in this directory
This directory contains all the preprocessors produced by the IMAGE project. Not all the preprocessors here are currently running on our server at https://image.a11y.mcgill.ca! Some preprocessors are now deprecated and have been replaced, but are kept here for documentation and reference.

For more information, consult the individual READMEs of the individual preprocessors.
