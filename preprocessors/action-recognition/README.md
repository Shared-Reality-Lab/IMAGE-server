# About

This preprocessor is used for detecting human action from images. The model used is DINOv2 ViT-S/14 distilled, released by Meta AI Research (https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2).

The preprocessor uses the output from object detection to find people in the graphic and then outputs any actions detected with confidence over 50%.
