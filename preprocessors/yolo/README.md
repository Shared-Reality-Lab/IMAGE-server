This preprocessor detects the objects present in the image. The entire code for this preprocessor has been refered from [YOLOv5 Repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).

In order to run this preprocessor we have used the [YOLOv5 image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/yolov5) as a base docker image.The following commands import the base docker image:

```docker build -t <image-name>``` (pulls in the YOLOv6 version) 

```docker run -p <port-number>:5000 <image-name>```


The above mentioned commands will run the YOLOv6 version avalable in Docker Hub. In order to make the v6 version compatible with our architecture we have made a few changes in detect.py. The detect.py has been commented approprately to highlight the changes.
