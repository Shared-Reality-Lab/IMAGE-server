# Expression Recognition Preprocessor

This preprocessor has been created in order to detect expressions of an individual person. The output generated by a preprocessor would be ```happy, neutral or sad.``` The code is built on [Deepface](https://github.com/serengil/deepface). There are several available models such as FaceNet, Openface, DeepFace etc. The code can be modified to use either of the models. The modifications need to be performed on `line 105` to specify which model should be used for analysis. 

The code to use this module as an API can be found in emotion-recognition.py. This module is fully versionned, the versions of the libraries used can be found in `requirements.txt` and in the `Dockerfile`.


It is to be noted that AI models learn human biases reflected in the datasets, leading to incorrect predictions. For example, when a popular emotion recognition model was used on NBA players, the model detected that African-American players were twice as angry compared to their white counterparts \cite{rhue_2019}. Hence such models should be used with caution as it might lead to offensive results. 


## Installation

In order to use this module as an API, first build the image using :

```bash
docker build -t <image-name>
```

Then run the container with :

```bash
docker run -d --rm --gpus all -p <port>:5000 <image-name>
```
