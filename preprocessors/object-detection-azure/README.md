Beta quality: Useful enough for testing by end-users.

This preprocessor uses the object detection feature of [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/concept-object-detection). Once the objects are detected, they are normalised and returned back in a pre-defined formate.

We have created a docker container to ensure ease of maintenance of the code.

```Note: This preprocessor would not work indivisually as it requires Azure API key for getting the outputs```
