# Hello SVG Handler

Beta quality: Useful enough for testing by end-users.

This is a test handler that generates SVGs to demonstrate how it could be done for a visual debugger.
The [visual debugger outputs](https://github.com/Shared-Reality-Lab/IMAGE-server/issues/117) should aid
designers in understanding the outputs of various preprocessors, especially computer vision related ones.
