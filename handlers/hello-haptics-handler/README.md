## Hello Haptics Handler [DEPRECATED]

This is a [handler](https://github.com/Shared-Reality-Lab/IMAGE-server/wiki/2.-Handlers,-Preprocessors-and-Services#handlers) component that acts as an example for the Haply 2DIY device. This handler provides the image blob as well as the centroid information for all the objects and segments in an image. 

This handler implementation is out of date, for a more recent example please see the [photo audio haptics handler](../..//handlers/photo-audio-handler)
