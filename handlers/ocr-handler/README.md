# OCR Handler [DEMONSTRATION]

This is a technical demonstration of the [OCR preprocessor](../../preprocessors/ocr) capabilities.
It outputs (as text only, no sonification or haptics created) the text strings found by the
[OCR preprocessor](../../preprocessors/ocr), and is not intended for end-user consumption.
We expect that in the future the OCR preprocessor results will likely be rolled
into the [photo audio handler](../photo-audio-handler).
