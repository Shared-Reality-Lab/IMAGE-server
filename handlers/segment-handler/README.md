## What is this?

This is an old handler that displayed semantic segmentation data. It has been succeeded by the combined [photo audio handler](../photo-audio-handler), which is more flexible and should be used instead of this.
This container requires the [ESPnet TTS service](../../services/espnet-tts) and [SuperCollider service](../../services/supercollider-images/supercollider-service/segment.scd).
