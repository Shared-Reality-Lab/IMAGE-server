## What is this?

This is a [handler](https://github.com/Shared-Reality-Lab/IMAGE-server/wiki/2.-Handlers,-Preprocessors-and-Services#handlers=) component that creates a spatialized audio scene to convey detected objects and detected semantic segments.

Data from these two sources are used to create a plain text description.
This description is used to create a text-to-speech rendering using [ESPnet](../../services/espnet-tts)
which is then passed to [SuperCollider](../../services/supercollider-images/supercollider-service/photo.scd).
For audio, it will be opportunistically returned as segmented audio. Otherwise, it will just return a simple audio rendering.
