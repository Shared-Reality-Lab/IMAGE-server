## What is this?

This is an old charts handler meant to use input from the [chart graphic preprocessor](../../preprocessors/chart-pipeline), which is no longer supported.
Due to difficulties in extracting accurate, useful data from a variety of sources, we
are now focused on sources that encode the data in another accessible format.
For work on that, see the [Highcharts handler](../high-charts).
