3.2 You are or shall be, the author and sole owner of copyright in the Contributions. You also represent and warrant that the Contributions are original to You and do not incorporate the work of others, except where explicitly noted in Your Contributions. 

3.3 Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to McGill University separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]."  

3.4 You have followed the instructions provided by McGill University if You do not own the Copyright in the entire work of authorship submitted. 

3.5 The exercise of the Acquired rights do not and will not: (i) violate or conflict with any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule, or regulation, (iii) conflict with, or result in (with or without notice or lapse of time or both), any violation of or default under, or give rise to a right of termination, acceleration, or modification of any obligation or loss of any benefit under, any contract or other instrument to which this Agreement or any of the Acquired Rights are subject, or (iii) result in the creation or imposition of any encumbrances on the Acquired Rights. No consent, approval, waiver, or authorization is required to be obtained by You from any person or entity (including any governmental authority) in connection with the execution, delivery, and performance by You of this Agreement, or to enable McGill University to use the Acquired Rights. 

3.6 You are in full compliance with all legal requirements applicable to the Acquired Rights and Your ownership and use thereof.

If Your Contributions were created in the course of Your employment with Your past or present employer(s), You represent that such employer(s) has authorized You to make Contributions on behalf of such employer(s) or such employer(s) has waived all of their right, title, or interest in or to Your Contributions.
