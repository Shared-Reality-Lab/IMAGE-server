## Set Up

Clone this repository. Note that the schemas are a submodule, so you need to either get them in the initial clone, e.g.,
```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Shared-Reality-Lab/auditory-haptic-graphics-server.git
```

or else get them after you've done the initial clone (while in the root of the cloned repo on your local machine):
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
